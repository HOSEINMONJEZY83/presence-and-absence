# presence-and-absence

A simple application for attendance using qrcode.
To use it, it is enough to first create a database and then enter the information of the persons one by one, which will create a qrcode for each stored person in a folder with the same name, then hold the qrcode in front of the camera until the presence of the person is registered.
